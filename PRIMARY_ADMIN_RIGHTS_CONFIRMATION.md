## Permission Methods in AdminPermissions Class

```dart
// All return true for Primary admins
static bool canAcceptUsers(String? adminTypeName) {
  return adminTypeName == primaryAdminType; // Primary only
}

static bool canCreateTypes(String? adminTypeName) {
  return adminTypeName == primaryAdminType; // Primary only
}

static bool canEditAllowances(String? adminTypeName) {
  return adminTypeName == primaryAdminType; // Primary only
}

static bool canModifyUserTypes(String? adminTypeName) {
  return adminTypeName == primaryAdminType; // Primary only
}

static bool canChangeAdminTypes(String? adminTypeName) {
  return adminTypeName == primaryAdminType; // Primary only
}

static bool canManageOrders(String? adminTypeName) {
  return adminTypeName == primaryAdminType || adminTypeName == secondaryAdminType;
}

static bool canViewReports(String? adminTypeName) {
  return adminTypeName == primaryAdminType || adminTypeName == secondaryAdminType;
}
```

## UI Implementation

The gebruikers page correctly implements these permissions:

1. **Primary Admins** see all buttons:
   - Approve/Reject (for pending users)
   - Deactivate (for active users)
   - Edit Admin Type
   - Change User Type
   - Edit Toelae

2. **Secondary Admins** see limited buttons:
   - No user management buttons
   - Can access orders/spyskaart management (if implemented)

3. **Tertiary Admins** see no management buttons:
   - Only basic access to admin portal
   - No user management capabilities

## Conclusion

✅ **Primary admins already have all rights and can do everything** as requested.

The role-based access control is properly implemented with Primary admins having complete access to all features while Secondary and Tertiary admins have appropriately restricted access based on their roles.
